    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>As a college student I am always looking for new experiences to open my outlook on the world. I have previously worked in Retail and Lifeguarding.It’s not clear to me yet what career path interests me the most which is another reason why I am always trying new things, obtaining new knowledge. Something I am very interested in trying is studying abroad because I love learning about other cultures and how different parts of the world operate. I think it’s very important for people to always look at life from new perspectives. </p>
